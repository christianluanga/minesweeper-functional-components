# react-minesweeper
This a simple minesweeper game made in react. This is a re-write of the game originally written by
@saninmersion using class components, I re-wrote the game using functional components the original 
version can be found here https://github.com/saninmersion/react-minesweeper/compare.

# config
There's no configurations required to run the game, just use npm or yarn to install the packages and you're good go.
